# MARKET SEGMENTATION:

## Analysis:

In order to better understand NutrientH20’s Twitter followers, Principal
Component Analysis was used. Before running the algorithm, the Tweets
under the ‘chatter’ and ‘uncategorized’ categories were removed as they
do not provide any useful information for a market segmentation. Next,
the data was normalized to use the percentage of Tweets not the overall
number of Tweets in each category. PCA was run to obtain 3 principal
components, as these explain 35% of the variance in the data, to
understand the categories these people tweeted about and assign them to
a client
archetype.

## Findings:

| Component | Most Tweeted                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| PC1       | Health and Nutrition, Personal Fitness, Cooking, Outdoors  |
| PC2       | Photo Sharing, Cooking, Shopping, Fashion                  |
| PC3       | College/University, Online Gaming, Sports Playing, TV/Film |

According to these components, a couple archetypes emerged.

**1. The outdoorsy:** This segment corresponds to the followers that are
high on component 1. They tend to be health conscious people that are
concerned with their fitness, which means they are a great target for
NutrientH20 for its conceived purpose of hydration.

**2. The social:** Follows trends and want to share it with their
network. They are buying the brand because it is perceived as cool or
new. They probably want to show the world they try new things.

**3. The college student:** They drink NutrientH20 just because it is
close by or because of the taste. They don’t really associate the brand
to a nutricious or sports related
drink.

## Conclusion:

Using this analysis, we believe that these three groups represent the
market segments for NutrientH2O. Each group should be marketed to in a
different way. The first group cares about their health and sports
performance, they will buy NutrientH20 by associating the brand to high
performance sports figures. The second segment, is harder to market to
as they will drink it if enough people do it or if it is perceived as
cool. It is possible to use fashion figures or artists. A good way to
accomodate for both would be to get a sports and fashion forward figure
such as David Beckham as a brand ambassador. The last market segment is
all about being a “healthy” alternative to sugar sodas. They will buy it
if it is readily available, and getting NutrientH2O placed in vending
machines and/or sold at markets around high schools and college
campuses.

Lastly, it is important to remark that all three segments have politics
and travel among their least tweeted topics. A good recommendation would
be to stay away from politics as these followers are not concerned with
it and could possibly be alienated by politics. On the other hand,
trying to associate the brand with travelling might bring forward new
segments.
